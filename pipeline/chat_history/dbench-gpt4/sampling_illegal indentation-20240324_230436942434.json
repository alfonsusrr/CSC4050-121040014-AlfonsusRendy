Start from the line indicated and trace back to the beginning of the block (e.g., the start of a loop, a conditional statement, or a function/class definition) to ensure that the code structure logically aligns with Python's indentation rules, which require blocks under the same control statement to be indented the same amount. In cases without explicit error messages or for preemptive checking, compare each line to ensure siblings in the code structure (e.g., consecutive lines under the same loop or branches of an if-else statement) share the same indentation level using spaces or tabs consistently. Additionally, for nested blocks, verify that each inner block is indented further to the right than its enclosing block. If any line breaks these rules, adjust the indentation to conform to the expected hierarchy of code blocks. This process should be repeated for every logical block within the code structure to rectify all potential indentation issues effectively. </heuristic>"}
