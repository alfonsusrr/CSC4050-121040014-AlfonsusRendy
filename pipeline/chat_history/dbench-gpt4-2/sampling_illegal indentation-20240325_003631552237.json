Localization Heuristic for Indentation Errors in Python Code** \n\n1. **Prerequisites:** This heuristic requires the Python code to be parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Python's `ast` module can be utilized for parsing the code. The process also relies on having access to the error message generated upon attempting to run the code if any, as Python's interpreter itself provides explicit information on indentation errors.\n\n2. **Step 1 - Parse Code into AST:** Convert the given Python code into an AST. This helps in understanding the structural elements of the code, like classes, functions, loops, conditionals, etc.\n\n3. **Step 2 - Traverse the AST:** Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on the AST. During traversal, for each node visited, record its type (e.g., ClassDef, FunctionDef, If, For, While, etc.), its corresponding line number in the source code, and the nesting level (depth in the tree).\n\n4. **Step 3 - Detect Anomalies in Nesting Levels:** Since properly indented Python code will exhibit a consistent increase or decrease in nesting levels as you move through the code linearly, track the changes in nesting levels as you traverse the tree. A sudden, unaccounted change in nesting level without a corresponding structural element (like entering or exiting a scope) suggests a potential indentation error.\n\n5. **Step 4 - Correlate with Python Error Message (If Available):** If a Python error message is available and indicates a specific line, cross-reference this line number with the line numbers recorded in the AST. Identify the node type at this line and examine its computed nesting level in comparison to adjacent elements.\n\n6. **Mathematical Formulation:**\n    - Let \\(N\\) be a node in the AST, with \\(N_{type}\\) its type, \\(N_{line}\\) its line number, and \\(N_{level}\\) its nesting level.\n    - For a given node \\(N\\), if the difference in nesting levels \\(|N_{level} - N_{level-1}|\\) for adjacent nodes (or logically related nodes, e.g., nodes within the same block of code) is greater than 1 without a corresponding logical scope transition, an indentation error is suspected at \\(N_{line}\\).\n\n7. **Step 5 - Highlight Suspected Lines:** Highlight the lines of code identified in Step 4 as potentially having indentation issues. For a comprehensive analysis, integrate context by considering lines immediately above and below the suspected indentation error, as the fault might be due to incorrect indentation in surrounding lines.\n\n8. **Reporting:** Generate a report listing all suspected incorrect indentations with recommended corrections based on the anticipated correct nesting level or provide a notification if the logical structure seems incorrect (e.g., a missing or extra loop, conditional block, etc.).\n\nBy applying this heuristic to a codebase, one can systematically identify and locate indentation errors, which are common yet can be challenging to debug, especially in larger Python programs. \n\n</heuristic>"}
