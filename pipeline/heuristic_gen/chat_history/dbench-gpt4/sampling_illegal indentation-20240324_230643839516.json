Pay close attention to colon (:) symbols, as each one introduces a block that requires indentation. If a line seems out of place or a block appears malformed, visually align the code blocks under their correct parent statements. Use Python\u2019s convention of 4 spaces per indentation level for consistency. For each suspicious line, compare its indentation level with the surrounding code to ensure it matches the expected block structure. In cases where a line is incorrectly indented, adjust it to align with the block it logically belongs to. If an error message specifically points to an indentation problem, go directly to the indicated line number and adjust as necessary, also checking adjacent lines for related issues. Finally, after adjustments, run the code again to see if the problem persists or if there are more indentation errors to fix, iterating over these steps until the code runs without indentation errors.\n</heuristic>"}
